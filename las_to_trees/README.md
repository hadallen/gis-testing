First off, loading a LAS file into R and plotting it is a super easy way to visualize what LiDAR data looks like for an area:

It is hard to see much detail in that first image, but you can plot it with various options. Here is classification by type:

You can see the red is buildings, green is trees, and the white/blue is ground (I don't know if that is two layers or not).

You can also create CHM rasters, as seen below:

Taken further, you can segment and isolate the individual trees from the LAS data:

And also show the crown spread polygons of each individual tree (coloured by height):

There is so much more to this program that I don't even know about yet. Super cool! Just wanted to share
